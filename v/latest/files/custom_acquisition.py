# ### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
# 
# The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function balances exploration and exploitation by assigning a score of $\mu + \sqrt{\beta} \cdot \sigma$ if the posterior distribution is normal with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. This "analytic" version is implemented in the `UpperConfidenceBound` class. The Monte Carlo version of UCB is implemented in the `qUpperConfidenceBound` class, which also allows for q-batches of size greater than one. (The derivation of q-UCB is given in Appendix A of [Wilson et. al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00424.pdf)).
# 
# ### A scalarized version of q-UCB
# 
# Suppose now that we are in a multi-output setting, where, e.g., we model the effects of a design on multiple metrics. We first show a simple extension of the q-UCB acquisition function that accepts a multi-output model and performs q-UCB on a scalarized version of the multiple outputs, achieved via a vector of weights. Implementing a new acquisition function in botorch is easy; one simply needs to implement the constructor and a `forward` method.

# Note that `qScalarizedUpperConfidenceBound` is very similar to `qUpperConfidenceBound` and only requires a few lines of new code to accomodate scalarization of multiple outputs. The `@t_batch_mode_transform` decorator ensures that the input `X` has an explicit t-batch dimension (code comments are added with shapes for clarity).
# 
# See the end of this tutorial for a quick and easy way of achieving the same scalarization effect using `ScalarizedPosteriorTransform`.

# #### Ad-hoc testing q-Scalarized-UCB
# 
# Before hooking the newly defined acquisition function into a Bayesian Optimization loop, we should test it. For this we'll just make sure that it properly evaluates on a compatible multi-output model. Here we just define a basic multi-output `SingleTaskGP` model trained on synthetic data.

# In[3]:

from botorch.models import SingleTaskGP
from botorch.utils import standardize

# generate synthetic data
X = torch.rand(20, 2)
Y = torch.stack([torch.sin(X[:, 0]), torch.cos(X[:, 1])], -1)
Y = standardize(Y)  # standardize to zero mean unit variance

# construct and fit the multi-output model
gp = SingleTaskGP(X, Y)
mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(gp.likelihood, gp)
fit_gpytorch_mll(mll)

# construct the acquisition function
qSUCB = qScalarizedUpperConfidenceBound(gp, beta=0.1, weights=torch.tensor([0.1, 0.5]))

# evaluate on single q-batch with q=3
qSUCB(torch.rand(3, 2))


# In[5]:


# batch-evaluate on two q-batches with q=3
qSUCB(torch.rand(2, 3, 2))


# ### A scalarized version of analytic UCB (`q=1` only)
# 
# We can also write an *analytic* version of UCB for a multi-output model, assuming a multivariate normal posterior and `q=1`. The new class `ScalarizedUpperConfidenceBound` subclasses `AnalyticAcquisitionFunction` instead of `MCAcquisitionFunction`. In contrast to the MC version, instead of using the weights on the MC samples, we directly scalarize the mean vector $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and apply standard UCB on the univariate normal distribution, which has mean $w^T \mu$ and variance $w^T \Sigma w$. In addition to the `@t_batch_transform` decorator, here we are also using `expected_q=1` to ensure the input `X` has a `q=1`.
# 
# *Note:* BoTorch also provides a `ScalarizedPosteriorTransform` abstraction that can be used with any existing analytic acqusition functions and automatically performs the scalarization we implement manually below. See the end of this tutorial for a usage example.

# ### Setting up a `GenerationStrategy` using `BOTORCH_MODULAR` with our custom acquistion function.
# 
# `BOTORCH_MODULAR` is a convenient wrapper implemented in Ax that facilitates the use of custom BoTorch models and acquisition functions in Ax experiments. In order to customize the way the candidates are generated, we need to construct a new `GenerationStrategy` and pass it into the `AxClient`.
