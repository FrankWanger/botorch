# # Risk averse Bayesian optimization with input perturbations
# 
# This notebook considers risk averse Bayesian optimization of objectives $f(x + \Delta_x)$, where $x$ denotes the design variable and $\Delta_x$ denotes the perturbations to the inputs that are applied at the implementation phase, such as manufacturing errors. 
# The design variable $x$ is fully controlled by the practitioner, however, the input perturbation $\Delta_x$ is only controllable at the experimentation phase and is determined by the environment once the decision $x$ is implemented, according to some probability distribution.
# This means that while optimizing the design, we can simulate $f(x)$ for any given $x$, however, once the optimization is done, the actual implemented solution becomes $x + \Delta_x$.
# 
# In this setting, we want to find high-performing designs that are also robust to the effects of the input perturbations. 
# To do so, we will follow the Bayesian optimization of risk measures framework introduced in [1]. 
# Please refer to the [Risk averse Bayesian optimization with environmental variables](https://botorch.org/tutorials/risk_averse_bo_with_environmental_variables) notebook for additional background on this.
# 
# In this notebook, we will use the `qNoisyExpectedImprovement` acquisition function to optimize the VaR risk measure at risk level $\alpha=0.8$, computed w.r.t. the perturbations in the inputs. To do so, we will:
#  - Use `InputPerturbation` input transform to add a set of samples of $\Delta_x$ to each given $x$;
#  - Calculate the joint posterior over these samples;
#  - Use the `RiskMeasureMCObjective` to convert these joint samples into samples of the risk measure;
#  - And use these risk measure samples to define the improvement in `qNoisyExpectedImprovement`.
# 
# We will use the (negated) SixHumpCamel test function, and assume that the input perturbations follow a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation of 5% of the parameter space (truncated to the parameter bounds). 
# During optimization, we will use 16 (qMC) samples of $\Delta_x$ to approximate the VaR risk measure.
# 
# VaR, the Value-at-Risk, is a risk measure that measures the worst possible outcome (small rewards or large losses) after excluding the worst outcomes with a total probability of $1 - \alpha$. 
# It is commonly used in finance for risk management, and corresponds to the $1 - \alpha$ quantile of the random variable.
# 
# Note: Risk measures are typically studied in the context of a minimization problem (including in [1]), since it makes more sense to minimize "risk", and treat the larger values as being undesirable. Since the default behavior in BoTorch is to maximize the objective, the `RiskMeasureMCObjective` (and its subclasses) is defined w.r.t. the lower tail of the random variable, i.e., by treating the smaller values as undesirable. With this implementation, all that is needed to minimize a risk measure (of the original objective) is to negate the objective, as is done in this notebook.
